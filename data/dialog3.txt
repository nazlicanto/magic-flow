Project Timeline Meeting: AI-Powered Medical Imaging Assistant
Date: November 24, 2024
Time: 2:00 PM EST
Attendees: Dr. Emily Chang (Lead Radiologist), Mike Foster (Project Manager), Dr. Raj Patel (AI Specialist), Lisa Wong (Data Privacy Officer), Alex Martinez (UI/UX Lead), Dr. Sarah Bennett (Clinical Operations)
[Meeting begins]
Mike: Hi everyone! Thanks for joining our timeline planning session for the Medical Imaging AI Assistant project. Can everyone hear me?
All: [Various confirmations]
Mike: Great. I've created a proposed timeline, but I want to get everyone's input, especially regarding regulatory compliance and clinical integration.
Dr. Chang: [Adjusting headphones] Before we dive in, I want to emphasize that we need thorough validation before any clinical deployment. Patient safety is our top priority.
Mike: Absolutely. Let's break this down phase by phase. Raj, can you start with the AI development timeline?
Dr. Patel: [Sharing screen] Sure. We're looking at a 15-month development cycle, broken down as follows:

Months 1-3 (December 2024 - February 2025): Data collection and preparation
Months 4-6 (March - May 2025): Initial model development for X-rays
Months 7-9 (June - August 2025): Expanding to CT scans
Months 10-12 (September - November 2025): MRI integration
Months 13-15 (December 2025 - February 2026): Fine-tuning and optimization

Lisa: [Raises hand] The data collection phase needs to account for HIPAA compliance and patient consent protocols. I'll need at least 6 weeks at the start to set up proper data governance frameworks.
Mike: Noted. Raj, does that affect your timeline?
Dr. Patel: We can parallel-track this. While Lisa handles compliance, my team can work on the AI architecture. We already have access to some public datasets for initial development.
Alex: [Child briefly visible in background] Sorry about that! Regarding the UI, we'll need consistent feedback from radiologists. I propose this timeline:

December 2024 - January 2025: Initial UI/UX research and wireframes
February - March 2025: First prototype
April - May 2025: User testing and iterations
June 2025: Final UI design
July 2025 onwards: Continuous refinement based on user feedback

Dr. Bennett: [Connection freezes briefly] The clinical integration timeline is crucial. We need to account for:

3 months for initial staff training (March - May 2025)
2 months for pilot testing in non-critical cases (June - July 2025)
4 months for supervised clinical trials (August - November 2025)
2 months for performance review and adjustments (December 2025 - January 2026)

Dr. Chang: [Siren heard in background] Sorry, I'm at the hospital. I agree with Sarah's timeline, but we should add a month for radiologist feedback integration after each major feature release.
Mike: Good point. Lisa, what about regulatory approvals?
Lisa: [Sharing document] We're looking at:

FDA submission prep: 4 months (March - June 2025)
Expected review period: 6-8 months (July 2025 - February 2026)
CE marking for European markets: parallel track, 8-10 months (May 2025 - February 2026)

Dr. Patel: [Adjusting camera] While waiting for approvals, we can use that time to improve model accuracy. I expect we can achieve:

90% accuracy by month 6 (May 2025)
95% by month 9 (August 2025)
98% by month 12 (November 2025)
99%+ by final release (February 2026)

Mike: Excellent. So for the overall timeline:

Project kickoff: December 2024
First working prototype: May 2025
Clinical trials begin: August 2025
Regulatory submissions: March 2025
Full deployment: March 2026

Dr. Bennett: [Notification sound] We should also plan for quarterly reviews of system performance post-deployment.
Alex: And monthly user feedback sessions starting from the first prototype.
Mike: Perfect. I'm seeing some key milestones here. Let me break this down:

Q4 2024 (Current quarter):

Project initiation
Data governance setup
Initial UI research


Q1 2025:

Data collection completion
First UI prototype
Begin X-ray model development


Q2 2025:

FDA submission
Staff training begins
CT scan integration starts


Q3 2025:

Clinical trials begin
MRI model development
Full UI deployment


Q4 2025:

Performance optimization
Clinical trial completion
Final system integration


Q1 2026:

Regulatory approval expected
Final adjustments
Preparation for full deployment


Q2 2026:

Full system deployment
Post-deployment monitoring
Continuous improvement phase



Dr. Chang: This timeline looks realistic, but we should build in some buffer for unexpected challenges.
Mike: Agreed. I'll add two weeks of buffer to each major phase. Shall we schedule weekly progress checks?
All: [Various agreements]
Mike: Great! I'll send out the detailed timeline with all dependencies mapped out. Same time next week for our first progress review?
All: [Confirming]
Mike: Thanks everyone! Let's make this happen.
[Meeting ends]

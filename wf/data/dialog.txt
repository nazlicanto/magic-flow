# Meeting Transcript: Product Review Sentiment Analysis Project
Date: November 17, 2024
Time: 10:00 AM
Attendees: Sarah (Project Manager), Alex (Data Scientist), Maria (Product Owner), Tom (Developer)

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Today we'll be discussing the new project for analyzing customer sentiment in product reviews. Alex, would you like to give us a brief overview of what you've been thinking?

Alex: Sure. Based on initial assessment, we're looking at implementing a Natural Language Processing model that can analyze the emotional tone of customer reviews and generate sentiment scores on a scale from -1 to 1.

Maria: That sounds promising. Are we planning to analyze historical data first, or will this be implemented for new reviews only?

Tom: From a technical perspective, we should probably do both. We can batch process the historical data to establish a baseline, then set up real-time processing for new reviews.

Sarah: Good point, Tom. What kind of timeline are we looking at for implementation?

Alex: I estimate about two weeks for the model development and training. We have about 50,000 historical reviews we can use as training data.

Maria: Are we considering any specific features beyond just positive/negative sentiment? Our product team would love to see topic clustering as well.

Alex: Actually, that's a great suggestion. We could implement aspect-based sentiment analysis to identify specific product features that customers are commenting on.

Tom: That would require some additional backend work, but it's definitely doable. I'd say add another week for that feature.

Sarah: Let's scope this carefully. For the first iteration, shall we stick to basic sentiment scoring and add feature-specific analysis in phase two?

Maria: Agreed. Let's start with a solid foundation and build from there. Can we get a demo ready for the stakeholder meeting next month?
